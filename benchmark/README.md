  - Direction: Adversarial/misleading patterns
  
- **Landscape Navigation**
  - Topology: Valleys, plateaus, saddle points
  - Complexity: Multimodality, nonconvexity
  - Dynamics: Moving targets, shifting optima
  
- **Numerical Challenges**
  - Conditioning: Ill-conditioned problems
  - Scaling: Parameter scale variations
  - Stability: Numerical overflow/underflow

- **Learning Dynamics**
  - Memory: Long-term dependencies
  - Interaction: Multiplicative effects
